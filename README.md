# My FIT Projects

Welcome to my repository! Here you can find all the projects I've worked on during my studies at Brno University of Technology, Faculty of Information Technology.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to keep track of my projects and provide easy access to them for future reference.

## Don't steal!
So we don't have to meet at the disciplinary committee, don't steal anything from here, thank you.

Thank you for visiting!
